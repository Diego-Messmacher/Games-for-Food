# Games-for-Food
Code for a non-profit website with games to feed the food-insecure

I did not make this alone. Credit is given to: Lorenzo Hinke, Jake Freedman, Eze Cutin, and Joe Sulkes for their efforts in making this project possible

This project includes Html, CSS, Ruby, Javascript, and P5JS code all of which is used to create the website.

Please inform me or any of my colleagues listed above if you plan on using our code for any purposes.
Please give the appropriate credit even if you ask any of us to use the code!

Have fun and enjoy the many games and features our website has to offer!



This project was done with the help of Palmer Trinity School (https://www.palmertrinity.org/), especially Mr.Joseph Rivera who, although never wrote any
code, guided us and told us when anything needed improvement!
